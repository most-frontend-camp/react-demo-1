# Practice

## Replace prop drilling with context

In this example, toggling the checkbox changes the `imageSize` prop passed to each `<PlaceImage>`. 

The checkbox state is held in the top-level `App` component, but each `<PlaceImage>` needs to be aware of it.

Currently, `App` passes `imageSize` to List, which passes it to each `Place`, which passes it to the `PlaceImage`. 

Remove the `imageSize` prop, and instead pass it from the `App` component directly to `PlaceImage`.
